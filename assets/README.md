# Assets Directory

Place your application icons here:

- `icon.ico` - Windows application icon (256x256 recommended)
- `icon.png` - PNG version for other uses
- `icon.icns` - macOS icon (if building for Mac in the future)

## Creating Icons

You can use tools like:
- [Electron Icon Maker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/electron-icon-maker)
- [IconConverter](https://iconverticons.com/online/)
- Adobe Illustrator or Figma

The icon should represent your Salesforce Query Tool branding.
